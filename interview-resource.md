Tips:

1. Always try to use primitives before going with fancy implementations
2. In case of character count releated problems use integer array with character as index instead of HashMap
3. Most of the string releated problems can be solve using two pointers
4. reduce function calls as much as possible to speed up the algorithm eg. in case of string problems call toCharArray and store it in char array instead of calling charAt eveytime
5. In case of two pointer move the values if the new values are redundant and always keep the pointer operation ready
